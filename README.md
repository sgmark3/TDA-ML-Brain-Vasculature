# TDA-ML-Brain-Vasculature

Networks have geometric and topological phenotypes. 
In past work we have found that the topological phenotypes are distinct. Does the same happen for brain vasculature? 
Can we tell brain regions apart from topology alone?
To tackle these questions we propose the following hypothesis: zero-dimensional persistence diagrams and the persistence landscapes of undirected weighted graph/network samples from mice brain vasculature are sensitive to the hierarchical structure resulting from the combined effect of the network topology and the distribution of the radii/thicknesses of the vessel segments. In order to test the validity of the above hypothesis, the linear support vector classifiers are used to train a machine learning model to distinguish betweeen the original networks vs. the networks with the same topoology but randomly shuffled weights. Further, using the validity of this hypothesis, the vascular network samples from different parts of the brain can be distinguished based on same methodology.
